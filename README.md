# Keithley_GPT
Python module and gui for controlling Keithley 2400 series SMUs

## DE
Numba-compatible implementation of the self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm, introduced by Brest, Janez, et al. in "Self-adapting control parameters in differential evolution: A comparative study on numerical benchmark problems." IEEE transactions on evolutionary computation 10.6 (2006): 646-657

## GUI
Graphical User interface (ChatGPT-crafted)

## Keithley2400GPT
Control class for Keithley 2400 SMUs (ChatGPT-crafted)

## IV_characterization
Example code to acquire current-voltage data with the Keithley2400GPT control class.

## SDM_extraction
Script to extract single diode parameters from IV data.

## Fittings
Jupyter notebook used to generate figures

## LambertW approximation
Evaluates the main branch of the Lambert W function approximated via Newton-Raphson method and compares with the results from the scipy implementation.
